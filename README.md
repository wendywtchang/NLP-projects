## Deep learning
* #### Slot Filling Task
  * A natural language understanding task to fill slots in dialog system with a digital assistant command dataset. 
  * Using Pytorch and BERT model.

## Dialog system
* #### Relation Prediction of Semantic Parser in Knowledge Base Question Answering
  * Predict the relation given a question from Wikidata. 
  * Question sentences are processed with BERT embedding and predicted by a MLP model.


## Topic Modeling
* #### Topic Modeling in COVID-19 Papers in PubMed
  * Apply LDA model, an unsupervised approach, to explore different topics in abstracts of COVID-19 papers.

## Emotion analysis
* #### Sentiment Classifiers 
  * Building a LSTM model by using keras to classify six different sentiments. 
* #### Extract sentiment stimulus
  * Perform a name entity recognition task to extract sentences with emotional information.

## Auromatic Speech Recognition
* #### ASR in Mandarin-English Code-Switching Dataset
  * Building an ASR system by using kaldi toolkit with Mandarin-English codeswitching dataset SEAME.
